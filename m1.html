			<h3>Visual Analysis of Global Land Grabbing Dynamics</h3>
			<p>"Land Grabbing" is the term for a phenomenon happening globally since around 2000, describing a process whereby private corporations,
				mainly based in the Global North, purchase vast amounts of land, mainly located in the Global South.
				The goals are mostly the securing of scarce resources and acre land, in order to yield increased present or future profits.
				There are often negative effects on local communities, ranging from displacements to environmental degradation.</p>

			<h4> User Tasks </h4>
				<p>User tasks should provide the following functionalities, based on <a href="https://www.grain.org/article/entries/4479-grain-releases-data-set-with-over-400-global-land-grabs"> this </a> dataset (or similar):</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Which countries grab land?</li>
					<li>In which countries do land grabs occur?</li>
					<li>How much land (in hectares) is being grabbed? (in absolute / relative terms) </li>
					<li>How much money is being spent on the land?</li>
					<li>Which economic sectors are involved in a deal, and to what degree?</li>
					<li>How does economic data (e.g. HDI, GDP) of grabber countries compare with grabbed countries?</li>
					<li>How does economic data (eg. HDI, GDP) of a particular country, or its proximity to the equator influence its land grab deals?</li>
				</ul>
			</p>
		</div>

		<div class = "implementation">
			<h5> Implementation </h5>
			<p>
				The starting point are two interlinked diagrams (1,2);
				<ul>
					<li>(1) A world map, where grabber and grabbed countries are marked by two colours.
						If a country is selected in (1), the countries are selected in (2) aswell, and vice versa. </li>
					<li> There is a tooltip functionality (3) for each relevant country, that shows country specific economic data. </li>
					<li>(2) A circular dependency diagram (hierarchical edge bundling chart) where the global flow of land, and the scale of the deals (in terms of hectares sold) are depicted.
					 Each land deal in the dataset is depicted as <a href ="https://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/7607999"> a flow of land from one country (node) to another.</a> There are two directions of flows (marked by different colours): grabber country to grabbed, and vice versa.
				  </li>
					<li> A tooltip (4) for each country shows detailed transaction information:
							<ul>
								<li>Total sold, </li>
								<li>total bought, </li>
								<li>average purchase price, </li>
								<li>average selling price, and </li>
								<li>type of economic sector. </li>
					</li>
				</ul>
				<li> For the exploration of user-specific interests, filters could be applied based on HDI or proximity to the equator, e.g. select only countries with a HDI under 0.5. </li>
			</ul>
